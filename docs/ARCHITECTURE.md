# Silent Forge Engine Architecture

## Overview

The Silent Forge Engine is designed with a modular, component-based architecture that emphasizes:
- Clean separation of concerns
- High performance
- Extensibility
- Maintainability

## Core Components

### 1. Engine Core
- **Window Management**: Handles platform-specific window creation and management
- **Input System**: Processes user input from various sources
- **Resource Management**: Manages loading and caching of assets
- **Event System**: Handles inter-component communication

### 2. Rendering System
- **Renderer**: Main rendering pipeline
- **Shader Management**: Compilation and management of GLSL shaders
- **Material System**: Material properties and shader binding
- **Mesh System**: Geometry processing and rendering
- **Texture System**: Texture loading and management

### 3. Scene Management
- **Scene Graph**: Hierarchical organization of game objects
- **Entity Component System**: Flexible object composition
- **Transform System**: Spatial transformations and hierarchy
- **Camera System**: View and projection management

### 4. Input System
- **Gamepad Support**: Platform-agnostic gamepad input handling
- **Gamepad Configuration**: JSON-based binding system for gamepad controls
  - Supports Windows XInput, Linux SDL2, and macOS MFi controllers
  - Configurable button and axis mappings
  - Cross-platform compatibility
  - Integration with core input system
  - Tested via `tests/core/config_test.cpp` (>80% coverage)
  - Validates SDL2 button/axis enums
  - Handles malformed JSON and file errors

## Design Patterns

### Component-Based Architecture
- Entities are composed of components
- Components are data-only structures
- Systems process components of specific types

### Observer Pattern
- Used in the event system
- Enables loose coupling between systems
- Facilitates reactive programming

### Factory Pattern
- Used for object creation
- Centralizes initialization logic
- Enables dependency injection

## Data Flow

1. **Initialization**
   - Engine core initializes
   - Systems register with the event system
   - Resources are loaded

2. **Main Loop**
   - Process input
   - Update game state
   - Render scene
   - Handle events

3. **Cleanup**
   - Release resources
   - Shutdown systems
   - Close window

## Performance Considerations

- **Memory Management**
  - Use of smart pointers
  - Custom allocators for critical paths
  - Memory pooling for frequent allocations

- **Rendering Optimization**
  - Batch rendering
  - Frustum culling
  - Level of detail system
  - Occlusion culling

## Extension Points

1. **Custom Components**
   - Inherit from base component
   - Register with component factory
   - Implement required interfaces

2. **Custom Systems**
   - Inherit from base system
   - Register with engine core
   - Process relevant components

3. **Custom Shaders**
   - Follow shader interface
   - Register with shader manager
   - Implement required uniforms

## Best Practices

1. **Code Organization**
   - Keep components small and focused
   - Use namespaces for logical grouping
   - Follow SOLID principles

2. **Memory Management**
   - Use RAII principles
   - Avoid raw pointers
   - Profile memory usage

3. **Performance**
   - Profile critical paths
   - Use appropriate data structures
   - Minimize allocations in hot paths

4. **Testing**
   - Unit test components
   - Integration test systems
   - Performance test critical paths
