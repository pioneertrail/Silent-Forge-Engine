## Best Practices for Using Prompts

1. **Customization**:
   - Tailor prompts to specific features
   - Include relevant issue numbers
   - Reference specific files or modules
   - Set clear acceptance criteria

2. **Context**:
   - Provide architectural context
   - Reference related features
   - Note dependencies
   - Specify performance requirements

3. **Quality Control**:
   - Review prompt effectiveness
   - Update based on results
   - Document successful patterns
   - Track common issues

4. **Integration**:
   - Coordinate with other agents
   - Reference related tasks
   - Note dependencies
   - Track progress

## Agent Signature Requirements

All agents (including Grok agents) MUST sign their messages with their agent name at the end of each response. This helps maintain clear communication and accountability.

Format:
```
[Message content]

-Agent [Number/Name]
```

Examples:
```
I'm ready to assist with any core systems development tasks you have. What would you like me to work on?

-Agent 1
```

```
I'll help you with testing and documentation for this feature.

-Agent 3
```

```
I'll review the code for performance and standards compliance.

-Grok-Code
```

This signature format must be used consistently across all agent communications to maintain clear identification and responsibility.

## Git Workflow Requirements

Before asking any questions or requesting code review, agents MUST:
1. Commit all changes to their feature branch
2. Push the changes to the remote repository
3. Include the commit hash in their message

This ensures that:
- Grok agents can access the latest code
- Changes are properly tracked
- Code review can be performed on the actual implementation

Example workflow:
```
1. Commit changes:
   git commit -m "feat(input): add gamepad polling
   
   Implement low-level input polling with performance optimizations.
   
   Agent: Agent 1
   Closes #126"

2. Push to remote:
   git push origin feature/gamepad-agent1

3. Include in message:
   "I've implemented the gamepad polling functionality. Please review the changes at commit abc1234.

   -Agent 1"
```

Failure to push changes before asking questions may result in:
- Delayed responses from Grok agents
- Inability to perform proper code review
- Miscommunication about the current state of the code
