## Description
Add a logging utility function to the Silent Forge Engine to test a fresh agent's ability to follow its role and workflow. The task is low-risk and focuses on basic functionality.

## Agent Assignments

### Agent 1: Core Systems Development
- [ ] Implement `Log` class in `src/utils/log.cpp` with a `logMessage` function.
- [ ] Optimize for minimal overhead (< 0.01ms per call).
- [ ] Add Doxygen comments.
- [ ] Create branch: `feature/log-agent1`.

### Agent 2: Auxiliary Systems and Features
- [ ] Add logging configuration to `Config` class in `src/core/config.cpp`.
- [ ] Implement log level support (e.g., debug, info, error).
- [ ] Add Doxygen comments.
- [ ] Create branch: `feature/log-agent2`.

### Agent 3: Testing and Documentation
- [ ] Write unit tests for `Log` class in `tests/utils/log_test.cpp`.
- [ ] Update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` with logging details.
- [ ] Add changelog entry to `CHANGELOG.md`.
- [ ] Create branches: `test/log-agent3`, `docs/log-agent3`.

## Technical Requirements
- **Performance**: Logging < 0.01ms per call.
- **Compatibility**: Windows, Linux, macOS.
- **Documentation**: Doxygen comments, usage examples.
- **Testing**: >80% coverage, test debug/info/error levels.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Code follows `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- CI passes (build, tests, coverage, formatting).
- Documentation updated with examples.
- Tests cover edge cases (e.g., empty messages).

## Workflow
1. Read `docs/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` for role details.
2. Create specified branches and commits:
   ```
   feat(utils): add log class
   Agent: Agent 1
   Closes #<issue>
   ```
3. Submit PRs and verify CI.
4. Grok-Code reviews code; Grok-QA validates tests/docs.

## Test Cases
```cpp
TEST_F(LogTest, LogMessage) {
    Log log;
    log.logMessage(LogLevel::Info, "Test message");
    EXPECT_TRUE(log.hasMessage());
}
```

## Additional Context
The logging utility should support configurable levels and minimal performance impact, serving as a foundation for debugging.
